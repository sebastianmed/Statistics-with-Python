# Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my Data Science projects and analysis on various topics, including Airbnb data, health data, and more. The purpose of this portfolio is to present my work to potential employers and to highlight my skills and expertise in data science.

All of the projects in this portfolio will be aligned with the courses and skills I am learning. Currently, I am studying "Statistics with Python" by the University of Michigan, and after completing this course, I plan to study the specialization "Applied Data Science with Python" also by the University of Michigan.

## Projects

### Project 1: Airbnb Data Analysis

In this project, I analyzed Airbnb data to uncover insights and patterns about the rental market in New York city. I used Python and data visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create interactive charts and graphs that highlighted key trends. 

### Project 2: Health Data Analysis

Will be added soon
